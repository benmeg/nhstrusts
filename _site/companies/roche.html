        The results of clinical trials are routinely and legally withheld from doctors, researchers, and patients. We have assessed every company’s policy on clinical trials transparency to see whether they meet a series of standard transparency criteria, and checked our findings with the companies. We have then applied a score to each commitment, and used these to rank the companies. You can see all our raw data, and review our methods, on this site.

          <h3>Why Registration is important</h3>
          <p class="intro">Before a trial is started, it should be “registered”: a description of the trial is posted on a publicly accessible trial registry, recognised by the World Health Organisation. This means that everyone knows the trial is happening, and will know if it is left unreported. It also helps readers detect if the trial has been designed, analysed, and reported correctly.  This graph shows how Roche&rsquo;s policy on registration compares to others&rsquo;.</p>
          <div class="stacked-bar-chart stacked-bar-chart--registration" data-section="registration"></div>
          <h3>Measures</h3>
          <p>We assess every company’s policy by reading through their commitments, and checking off whether they meet a range of criteria. We send every company our assessment, then apply a scoring system to each element. You can read about the scoring system <a href="/our-scoring-method/">here</a>. You can read our detailed assessment of whether Roche meets each of our criteria, below.</p>
          <dl class="results-breakdown">
            
              <dt><code>registration_1</code>: Do they have a policy to register all trials (excepting specific exclusions in later columns) from now? </dt>
              <dd>Unclear / this is hard to code. roche's policy pdf "roche global policy on sharing of clinical trials data" does not appear to make a clear statement about registration. it has a section header that mentions it, but the text only refers to "summary reports": "clinical trial registration and posting of results on public web sitesroche is committed to providing comprehensive information on clinical trials conducted by roche to healthcare professionals and to the public, regardless of the outcome of these trials. roche posts summary reports on clinicaltrials.gov (ct.gov) for all roche-sponsored phase i clinical trials in patients, all phase ii–iv interventional and observational clinical trials, and all roche-sponsored interventional trials that use diagnostic products." there is another mention related to registration in a second roche policy document titled "roche global policy on sharing of clinical study information" that reads: "we publish information from our protocols and clinical study results information on clinical trial registries. clinical trial registries are an important source of information for physicians and patients because they help them to know if a study is recruiting, ongoing or is completed. clinical trial registries also help physicians and patients access results once available." again we do not view that as a clear commitment to register all trials. in addition, on the webpage "our commitment to data sharing", a third policy document containing information about roche's commitments, (http://www.roche.com/research_and_development/who_we_are_how_we_work/clinical_trials/our_commitment_to_data_sharing.htm ) they say: "roche's clinical trials registry was launched in 2004 with the aim of ensuring researchers and other interested parties could access protocols and also the results of our phase i to iv clinical studies" and "roche is committed to sharing data from clinical trials and has registered and posted summary reports for trials involving patients on appropriate clinical registries since 2005." collectively this may mean that roche register all trials, since 2005, but this is not made clear. this lack of clarity is made more problematic by the apparent conflict with the 2013 start date (see relevant field) for sharing all summary results: i.e., one could accept this vaguely worded commitment for 2005 as covering registration of all trials from 2005, but that would then naturally imply accepting that all summary results are shared from 2005 as well; however the parts of the roche policy document (or rather, documents) that discuss results policy appear to suggest 2013 as the start date for all trials to share summary results. therefore, although it is an edge case, this can only be realistically coded as unclear on registration, because it lacks a clear commitment to "all", and the most permissive/generous reading of the text produces a result that is inconsistent with other aspect of roche's policies. </dd>

The average duration of a clinical trial is 2 years, as per Pregelj 2015. Therefore we normalise to NOS date. If a company commitment is "trials initiated after 2010" then this becomes "2011", if the commitment is "trials completing after 2012" then this becomes "2011", and so on.

            It is important that doctors, researchers, and patients have access to the summary results of every trial. These are the kinds of results you would typically find in an academic journal article: how the people in each arm of the trial did, over the course of the trial, measured by various criteria. This graph shows how Roche’s policy on sharing summary results compares to others’.

          <h3>Why Clinical Study Reports are important</h3>
          <p class="intro">Clinical Study Reports (CSR) are large detailed documents, sometimes thousands of pages long, which contain a wealth of detail on the methods and results of a trial. That information is often missing from other sources: one recent study estimates that CSRs contain twice as much information on benefits and harms as academic papers on trials. CSRs are routinely created for industry trials, but are less well known in the academic community. They follow a standard format set out under international guidance. This graph shows how Roche’s policy on sharing CSRs compares to others’.</p>

          <h3>Why Individual Patient Data is important</h3>
          <p class="intro">Individual Patient Data (IPD) is the raw data collected during a clinical trial, with detailed information on each individual participant. It presents significant opportunities for research. For example, access to IPD can allow third parties to verify that trialists analysed their data correctly and fairly. It helps researchers combine data from lots of trials for more accurate comparisons of treatments. It helps see if a treatment is particularly effective, or unhelpful, in a subset of patients. It also allows entirely new hypotheses to be explored in existing data, helping to devise or refine new treatments. However it also presents a risk: individual patients can often be re-identified, and their privacy compromised, even with partially anonymised data. Because of this, IPD is not generally posted in public, but shared through various controlled access mechanisms, as with other forms of electronic health record data already used by medical researchers. This graph shows how Roche’s policy on sharing IPD compares to others’.</p>

Roche posts summary reports on ClinicalTrials.gov (CT.gov) for all Roche-sponsored Phase I clinical trials in patients, all Phase II–IV interventional and observational clinical trials, and all Roche-sponsored interventional trials that use diagnostic products.\" There is another mention related to registration in a second Roche policy document titled \"Roche Global Policy on Sharing of Clinical Study Information\" that reads: \"We publish information from our protocols and clinical study results information on clinical trial registries. Clinical trial registries are an important source of information for physicians and patients because they help them to know if a study is recruiting, ongoing or is completed. Clinical trial registries also help physicians and patients access results once available.\" Again we do not view that as a clear commitment to register all trials. In addition, on the webpage \"Our Commitment to Data Sharing\", a third policy document containing information about Roche's commitments, (http://www.roche.com/research_and_development/who_we_are_how_we_work/clinical_trials/our_commitment_to_data_sharing.htm ) they say: \"Roche's clinical trials registry was launched in 2004 with the aim of ensuring researchers and other interested parties could access protocols and also the results of our Phase I to IV clinical studies\" and \"Roche is committed to sharing data from clinical trials and has registered and posted summary reports for trials involving patients on appropriate clinical registries since 2005.\" Collectively this may mean that Roche register all trials, since 2005, but this is not made clear. This lack of clarity is made more problematic by the apparent conflict with the 2013 start date (see relevant field) for sharing all summary results: i.e., one could accept this vaguely worded commitment for 2005 as covering registration of all trials from 2005, but that would then naturally imply accepting that all summary results are shared from 2005 as well; however the parts of the Roche policy document (or rather, documents) that discuss results policy appear to suggest 2013 as the start date for all trials to share summary results. Therefore, although it is an edge case, this can only be realistically coded as unclear on registration, because it lacks a clear commitment to \"all\", and the most permissive/generous reading of the text produces a result that is inconsistent with other aspect of Roche's policies.
