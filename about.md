##About the project
This is a project aiming to drive up transparency standards by ensuring everyone is aware of the policy commitments being made. We hope that it will be useful for doctors, patients, researchers, policymakers, and companies themselves. If you are aware of any issues or corrections please get in touch.

##About the people
This project combines the skills of academics, clinicians, and policy advocates. It is run by Dr Ben Goldacre at the University of Oxford, and Dr Sile Lane at Sense About Science, who both help to run the AllTrials campaign for clinical trials transparency. The data on companies’ policy commitments was extracted and checked by a team of researchers at the University of Oxford including: Prof Carl Heneghan, Dr Igho Onakpoya, and Dr Kamal Mahtani.

##Sponsors
This work was supported by a grant from the Laura and John Arnold Foundation covering Dr Ben Goldacre’s work on transparency at the University of Oxford.
