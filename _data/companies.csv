In exceptional circumstances, access to data may be declined by the sponsor, for example, where there is a potential conflict of interest or an actual or potential competitive risk.Studies are considered for inclusion after the medicine studied has been approved by the regulatory authorities (first approval in the respective indication) or terminated from development (all indications) and the primary manuscript describing the results has been accepted for publication.When patients agreed to take part in UCB clinical studies they gave permission (through informed consent) to use their data to study the medicine or disease UCB were researching. Further research must therefore study the medicine or disease that was researched in the original studies. For studies starting January 2014, patients will be asked if they agree to give permission for data usage in analyses by UCB or outside academic researchers to answer additional scientific questions related to the study drug/condition. UCB will take appropriate measures to protect this information and will only use and share coded data for this additional research. A condition of providing the data to an external researcher is that the external researcher seeks publication of his/her research results in a peer-reviewed journal. UCB is to be provided with a copy of the manuscript for review prior to journal submission to prevent the unintended disclosure of UCB’s confidential information. UCB will not seek to influence the content of a publication or the opinion of the external researcher through the review of the publication. UCB supports publications that contain scientifically and/or clinically meaningful results. Other than identification of UCB’s confidential information, the final decision whether to accept any comments made by UCB remains with the external researcher.Where available, the following anonymised patient level data and information is provided in English only for each clinical study.Raw dataset. This is the data collected for each patient in the clinical study. Analysis-ready dataset. This is the dataset used for UCB’s analysis. Protocols with any amendments.

Whether UCB are able to provide the requested data. For example, the majority of non-interventional (or observational) studies use data from third party databases under license agreements which prevent UCB from providing access to the data. Researchers can access data directly from these third party databases under similar agreements. Whether UCB has the legal authority to provide the data. For example, UCB may not have the legal authority because the medicine has been out-licensed to another company.

Roche,$50bn,"Rituxan, Avastin, Herceptin","unclear / This is hard to code.

Roche posts summary reports on ClinicalTrials.gov (CT.gov) for all Roche-sponsored Phase I clinical trials in patients, all Phase II–IV interventional and observational clinical trials, and all Roche-sponsored interventional trials that use diagnostic products."" There is another mention related to registration in a second Roche policy document titled ""Roche Global Policy on Sharing of Clinical Study Information"" that reads: ""We publish information from our protocols and clinical study results information on clinical trial registries. Clinical trial registries are an important source of information for physicians and patients because they help them to know if a study is recruiting, ongoing or is completed. Clinical trial registries also help physicians and patients access results once available."" Again we do not view that as a clear commitment to register all trials.

Collectively this may mean that Roche register all trials, since 2005, but this is not made clear. This lack of clarity is made more problematic by the apparent conflict with the 2013 start date (see relevant field) for sharing all summary results: i.e., one could accept this vaguely worded commitment for 2005 as covering registration of all trials from 2005, but that would then naturally imply accepting that all summary results are shared from 2005 as well; however the parts of the Roche policy document (or rather, documents) that discuss results policy appear to suggest 2013 as the start date for all trials to share summary results. Therefore, although it is an edge case, this can only be realistically coded as unclear on registration, because it lacks a clear commitment to ""all"", and the most permissive/generous reading of the text produces a result that is inconsistent with other aspect of Roche's policies.
